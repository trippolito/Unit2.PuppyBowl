# Puppyy Bowl API Project

##  Welcome to the Puppy Bowl API! This API will allow users to manage the roster of adorable puppies participating in the Puppy Bowl. Whether you want to fetch player details, add a new player, or retrieve team information, this API has it all. 

## I will be updating the files and README as the project progresses so make sure to always stay refreshed on current code.

## Thank you for checking out my project and feel free to fork/clone as well.
